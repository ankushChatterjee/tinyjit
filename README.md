# TinyJIT

An educational JIT compiler that emits ARM64 machine code for a simple expression language.

This was made on a series of discord live streams,
and is (very obviously) not intended for production use.

I'm trying to write a small book about JIT compilation, and this repository
serves as the reference implementation for that.
